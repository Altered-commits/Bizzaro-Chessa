# Bizzaro Chessa
### A simple chess game but with a twist. It has following rules:
- Piece movement by dragging and dropping pieces
- Legal square highlighting
- King check highlighting
- Checkmate and Stalemate detection
- Pawn Promotion
### The twist: Piece place randomization. Every few seconds / minutes (time set by the user), the pieces are randomized
## Things to add in future:
- En passant
- King castling
